        This app is a game wherein a player connects their Spotify account and gets presented with a list of their
        playlists. They can then choose a playlist to either choose a song from it (if they wish to quiz a friend on a
        specific song or something), or have one picked at random. Once a song is chosen, the game begins, and a blank
        set of lines is shown on the screen. The player must then enter a number between 1 and the number of lines
        shown. Doing so results in the specified lyric being revealed to the player. The player has a maximum of 5 lines
        to have shown, and must make a guess as to what the song is based on those 5 or less lines

        I have satisfied this through the following:
        <ol>
          <li>
            When the screen is less than 1000px wide, the playlist display switches from a card display to a list one
          </li>
          <li>
            When the screen is less than 1000px wide, the back button moves to be closer to the app name
          </li>
          <li>
            When the screen is less than 1000px wide, the song selection button moves to be under the filter input
            location
          </li>
          <li>
            When the screen is less than 1000px wide, the container for the selectable content (playlists and songs)
            becomes smaller so as to fit the shifting of content without needing a scrollbar
          </li>
          <li>
            When the screen is less than 1000px wide, the lyrics display reduces its margin from the left side of the
            screen so as to fit better on screen
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        I have satisfied this through the following:
        <ol>
          <li>Using Spotify's API to authenticate and allow a user to play</li>
          <li>Using Spotify's API to retrieve the user's ID and playlists</li>
          <li>Using Spotify's API to retrieve the songs in the selected playlist</li>
          <li>Using MusixMatch's API to retrieve a MusixMatch ID through a song's ISRC value gotten from Spotify</li>
          <li>Using MusixMatch's API to retrieve the first 30% of the lyrics of the song specified by that ID</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        I have satisfied the search requirement by allowing a user to search through their list of playlists, the songs
        in a playlist, and the songs that can be answered in the game
      </li>
      <li>
        I have satisfied the "displays results" requirement through the appearance of a list of possible answers when
        searching for a song during the game
      </li>
      <li>
        I have satisfied the filterable results requirement by having the list of playlist cards be filterable by a
        search, as well as by having the list of songs in a playlist be filterable by a search
      </li>
    </ol>
